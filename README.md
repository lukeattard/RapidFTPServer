# RapidFTPWorkerService

Simple FTP Server for Windows.

Config the settings with the Configurator, and then start the service. 

Can also run the FTP as standalone on demand.

Release Files includes a NSIS installer, installs both the server and configurator into the same directory. Adds start menu Items, and also adds the service as autostart.
